# NL-Bankstatement-converter

NL Bankstatement converter is a small application to convert `csv` and `pdf` files from three specific Dutch banks / credit cards into a `csv` format that can be easily imported into [GNUCash](https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash).

The three banks that are currently supported:
* Rabobank - download transactions in `csv` file
* ASN Bank - download transactions in `csv` file
* ANWB ICS Credit Card - download transactions in monthly account statement `PDF`
