# NL-Bankstatement-converter

NL Bankstatement converter is a small application to convert `csv` and `pdf` files from three Dutch banks and one credit card provider into a `csv` format that can be easily imported into [GNUCash](https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash).

The four banks/cards that are currently supported:
* Rabobank - download transactions in `csv` file
* ASN Bank - download transactions in `csv` file
* ING Bank - download transactions in `csv` file
* ANWB VISA ICS Credit Card - download transactions in monthly account statement `PDF`

## Configuration

Set your settings in the properties file, like path and name as it is shown on your ANWB Visa ICS Credit Card.
